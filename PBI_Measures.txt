# Cases Table
Last Updated = LEFT(MAX(cases_df[Date of report]), 10)
Total Cases = COUNT(cases_df[Date of report])
Confirmed Cases = CALCULATE(COUNT(cases_df[Date of report]), FILTER(cases_df, cases_df[Confirmed_or_Probable] = 1))
Probable Cases = CALCULATE(COUNT(cases_df[Date of report]), FILTER(cases_df, cases_df[Confirmed_or_Probable] = 0))

# Summary Stats Table
Cases in Hospital = SUM(summary_stats_df[Number of cases currently in hospital])
Deaths = SUM(summary_stats_df[Number of deaths])
Recovered = SUM(summary_stats_df[Number of recovered cases])
Increase in confirmed cases within the last 24 hours = SUM(summary_stats_df[Increase in confirmed cases within 24 hours])
Increase in probable cases within the last 24 hours = SUM(summary_stats_df[Increase in probable cases within 24 hours])
