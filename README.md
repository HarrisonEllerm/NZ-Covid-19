# NZ-Covid-19

This script downloads data provided by the Ministry of Health related to COVID-19 in New Zealand and augments
it with geo-location data. It loads then loads this data into dataframes which are then imported into Power BI
as a way to hack up a quick dashboard.

This mini-project was used as a way to experiment with importing data into Power-BI via a python script. It is not
intended to be used as an official source of information related to COVID-19.
